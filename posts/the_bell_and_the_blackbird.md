title: The Bell and The Blackbird
subtitle: Where'd the name come from?
---
The name _Blackbird Bell_ comes from a poem by David Whyte called "The Bell and the Blackbird".  

> The sound of a bell \
> still reverberating,\
> or a blackbird calling\
> from the corner of a\
> field.\
> Asking you to wake\
> into this life\
> or inviting you deeper\
> into the one that waits.\
> Either way\
> takes courage,\
> either way wants you\
> to become that self \
> which is no self at all,\
> wants you to walk \
> to the place\
> where you find\
> you already know\
> how to give\
> every last thing away.\
> The approach\
> that is also the meeting itself,\
> without any\
> meeting at all.\
> You will walk\
> with that radiance\
> you have always\
> carried with you,\
> both alone\
> and completely\
> accompanied\
> in friendship\
> by every corner\
> of the world\
> crying\
> allelujah.

The poem is about the constant decision we make to live and enjoy the world as it is, or to invest and learn and grow in the world as it could be.  It's about the tension between the two, and the courage it takes to live in that tension.  

I've found so much meaning in the poem, and it applies to both how I experience the environment (should I go out and enjoy the natural world in its beauty and splendor? Or should we sit in front of a screen and fight for that splendor for my future self and future generations? The answer to both is "Yes").

It also applies to the work I do, which often takes the form of software tooling to get something done in the real world. We can use the tools we have at hand to get something done (I reach for Excel all the time), or we can craft a new tool that does the job better, more specialized, more efficient (I'm always in for building or buying something the makes the work so much easier and fulfilling).  And the same fractally downward, for each new feature, each new line of code, each new function.  We can use what we have, or we can build something new.  The tradeoff, knowing whether to listen to the Bell or to the Blackbird in each moment, with each decision, based on the needs and constraints, is the work of a lifetime.
