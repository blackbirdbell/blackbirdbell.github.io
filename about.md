Global energy systems don't transition themselves. It's going to take a lot of sweat, tears, steel, and code to get there. Fortunately, certain parts of the transition (like building software) have never been easier. Thanks to advancements in cloud, lightweight tools, and AI, software (and the analysis it enables) can be delivered in timelines never before possible.

That said, much if not most of the energy transition will be built by the people writing essential policy and putting new infrastructure in the ground. You're already an expert in your domain - you shouldn't have to be an expert in software trends too. 

Blackbird Bell is a new kind of software consultancy, one that provides lightweight software to the people and companies at the forefront of the energy transition. I'm Ryan, founder of Blackbird Bell, and I've worked my entire career at the intersection of climate, energy, and software. I'm here to take the software and analytics off your plate so you can focus on what you do best, with solutions delivered in days-to-weeks (not years).
